//The Commons.java file has some common constants//
//The WIDTH and HEIGHT constants store the dimensions of the board//
//When the ball passes the BOTTOM_EDGE, the game is over.//
//The N_OF_BRICKS is the number of bricks in the game//
//The INIT_PADDLE_X and INIT_PADDLE_Y are initial coordinates of the paddle object//
//The INIT_BALL_X and INIT_BALL_Y are initial coordinates of the ball object//
//The DELAY is the initial delay in milliseconds before task is to be exectures and the PERIOD is the time in milliseconds between successive task executions that form game cycles//
